I grew up loving to tinker with technology and computers. When I was eighteen, I built my first full-stack web app, then hacked it and stole my own data. This early experience was when I realized I wanted my love for coding and hacking to be a part of my daily life. Since 2009, I've been feeding that curiosity and love for computers into a healthy career, which has led me into Red Teaming, where I will probably never leave.

Aside from my career, I have a wonderful family, and enjoy learning new skills and hobbies.
